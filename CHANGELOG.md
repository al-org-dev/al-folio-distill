# Changelog

## 1.0.1 - 2026-02-17

- Updated Distill scripts template to use `tabs.js` (non-minified path) instead of removed `tabs.min.js`.
- Switched back-to-top loading to the shared CDN contract (`third_party_libraries['vanilla-back-to-top']`) to avoid missing local asset lookups.

## 1.0.0

- Initial Distill extraction from `al_folio_core`.
